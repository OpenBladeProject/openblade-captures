# Capturing an unsupported Razer Blade

This runbook is for protocol research on a Razer Blade model that OpenBlade does
not yet support. It does not authorize firmware writes. A command becomes a
production capability only after it passes every admission check in this guide
for the exact model and firmware family.

## Safety model

1. Work on native Windows 11 with the .NET SDK, Wireshark/tshark, USBPcap, and
   the vendor application used only as an oracle.
2. Keep the OpenBlade service stopped while USBPcap owns the target interface.
   The generic capture runner records and restores its prior service state.
3. Capture one operator action at a time. Never infer a command from a nearby
   model or combine exploratory writes.
4. Discover and implement read/query operations before testing a setter.
5. For every write validation, save the prior confirmed state, show the exact
   proposed change, require operator confirmation, apply once, query it, and
   restore the saved state.
6. Stop USBPcap only through the supplied isolated-process-group helper. Never
   call `GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent` with group `0`; that broadcasts to the parent
   console and can terminate Codex or PowerShell.
7. Raw captures stay local. USB traffic can contain serials, unique instance
   paths, keystrokes, and unrelated device data.

## Toolkit

- `tools/Get-BladeCaptureInventory.ps1` collects non-unique model, firmware,
  Windows, and Razer USB identities.
- `tools/New-CaptureWorkspace.ps1` creates an ignored local session with a
  versioned capture plan and operator log.
- `tools/Invoke-InteractiveUsbPcapCapture.ps1` runs USBPcapCMD in an isolated
  process group, stops it with a targeted Ctrl+Break, and restores the prior
  OpenBlade service state. It can select one or more verified device addresses
  on the same root for bounded cross-device correlation.
- `tools/Convert-UsbPcapToTransactions.ps1` uses tshark to decode a local PCAP
  into bounded transaction records.
- `tools/Compare-CaptureTransactions.ps1` compares baseline and one-action
  captures. Its semantic fingerprint removes transaction IDs, checksums, and
  unused padding from validated 90-byte and 374-byte Razer envelopes while
  retaining command and payload differences.
- `tools/New-SanitizedCaptureAnnotation.ps1` creates a commit-safe annotation
  skeleton with capture hashes and restoration results.
- `tools/Test-CaptureEvidence.ps1` checks provenance, redaction, evidence
  bounds, capture hashes, and restoration. Before committing, use `-PcapPath`
  to verify the local capture. Use `-SchemaOnly` only when the raw capture is
  intentionally unavailable.
- `tools/Test-UsbPcapShutdownSafety.ps1` checks that capture shutdown cannot
  broadcast Ctrl+C to the parent console.

Two scripts retain the reviewed cooling-pad fan-context investigation for the
exact RZ09-0581 BIOS 4.00 target:

- `tools/Invoke-CoolingPadFanContextCapture.ps1` records Synapse-owned
  Fixed/Auto transitions with lighting frames active, with lighting dark in the
  same Synapse process session, and after a verified fresh Synapse process
  session. OpenBlade remains stopped and sends no HID command.
- `tools/Analyze-CoolingPadFanContextCapture.ps1` compares the three bounded
  marker windows, requires exact Fixed/Auto request acknowledgements, counts
  lighting frames, and keeps process-session evidence separate from unresolved
  literal HID-handle ownership.

Other model-named `Analyze-*`, `Export-*`, `Get-*`, `Invoke-*`, and `Start-*`
scripts are exact-device helpers retained as reviewed evidence. They can wrap
an isolated oracle capture, export a bounded fixture, repeat a read-only matrix,
perform a reversible validation, or inspect a verified vendor backend. Do not
use them as generic starting points or copy their identities, interfaces,
addresses, hashes, paths, report geometry, or command bytes to another model.

## 1. Prepare the machine

Install:

- .NET 10 SDK
- Wireshark with tshark
- USBPcap
- the current vendor software for this laptop, temporarily

Verify the shutdown regression before any real capture:

```powershell
.\tools\Test-UsbPcapShutdownSafety.ps1
```

Create a non-unique inventory:

```powershell
.\tools\Get-BladeCaptureInventory.ps1 `
  -OutputPath .\raw\my-model\inventory.json
```

Review the output. It must contain the Razer model number, BIOS, Windows build,
and VID/PID pairs, but not the machine serial number or full PnP instance
suffixes. Record EC and MCU versions from a trustworthy UI or a later validated
query; do not guess them.

If the investigation concerns an installed Razer driver path, use the separate
[`blade-driver-catalog`](https://github.com/OSSBlade/blade-driver-catalog) for
package inventory and export instructions. This repository retains the protocol
and physical validation evidence. Driver Store exports and full device-instance
reports remain private.

For the exact Razer Laptop Cooling Pad (`1532:0F43`, USB revision `0200`),
record its USB interfaces and HID report geometry separately:

```powershell
.\tools\Get-CoolingPadCaptureInventory.ps1 `
  -OutputPath .\raw\cooling-pad-interface-inventory.json
```

This inventory opens HID collections with zero desired access and calls only
descriptor and preparsed-data APIs. It does not issue feature-report queries or
writes, and it never serializes a device-interface path, full instance ID,
container ID, location path, or serial number. The exact reviewed unit exposes
one 91-byte feature-report collection on `MI_00`; that proves a direct user-mode
HID transport is available, but it does not assign any command semantics.

## 2. Create a local session

```powershell
$session = .\tools\New-CaptureWorkspace.ps1 `
  -RootDirectory .\raw `
  -ModelNumber RZ09-XXXX `
  -VendorId 1532 `
  -ProductId 0000 `
  -BiosVersion 0.00 `
  -Purpose "battery charge limit query"
```

The command creates an ignored directory with:

- `capture-plan.json`: exact target, preconditions, action, expected observation,
  prior-state, readback, and restoration fields;
- `operator-log.md`: timestamps and notes;
- empty `baseline` and `action` directories.

Complete the plan before capture. Use a new session for every changed value.

## 3. Identify USBPcap root and device address

Run USBPcapCMD's device listing from an elevated terminal and match the target
by its USB hardware identity. Device addresses can change after reconnect,
resume, or reboot, so resolve them again for every session. If identity is
ambiguous, stop. Do not capture all devices merely to avoid identifying the
target.

The capture runner accepts `-AllDevices` only for descriptor discovery. An
action capture should use a single `-DeviceAddress`, or `-DeviceAddresses`
when one action must be correlated across two or more explicitly selected
devices on the same USBPcap root. Never substitute `-AllDevices` for a bounded
multi-device action capture.

## 4. Capture baseline and one action

Start the baseline capture from an elevated PowerShell:

```powershell
.\tools\Invoke-InteractiveUsbPcapCapture.ps1 `
  -UsbPcapDevice \\.\USBPcap3 `
  -DeviceAddress 2 `
  -OutputDirectory $session.BaselineDirectory
```

For a bounded paired capture on one root, pass the verified transient addresses
as an array. Re-resolve them after every unplug or reconnect:

```powershell
.\tools\Invoke-InteractiveUsbPcapCapture.ps1 `
  -UsbPcapDevice \\.\USBPcap3 `
  -DeviceAddresses 2,5 `
  -OutputDirectory $session.ActionDirectory
```

Leave the relevant vendor page idle for several seconds, then create the
`capture.stop` sentinel shown by the runner. Repeat in the action directory,
changing exactly one value once and leaving enough quiet time before and after
the action.

The runner does the following:

- starts USBPcapCMD with `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`;
- records PID, process-group ID, start time, executable, and output ownership;
- signals only that nonzero group with `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT` from a detached,
  protected worker;
- verifies graceful exit and nonempty output; and
- restores the OpenBlade service only if it was running before capture.

The interactive runner never chooses forced termination automatically. If
graceful shutdown fails, an operator may explicitly run
`Stop-UsbPcapCapture.ps1 -ForceFallback` against the retained ownership session.
Forced termination may lose buffered packets and must be disclosed in the
annotation.

## 5. Decode and compare

```powershell
.\tools\Convert-UsbPcapToTransactions.ps1 `
  -PcapPath $session.BaselinePcap `
  -OutputPath (Join-Path $session.Root "baseline-transactions.json")

.\tools\Convert-UsbPcapToTransactions.ps1 `
  -PcapPath $session.ActionPcap `
  -OutputPath (Join-Path $session.Root "action-transactions.json")

.\tools\Compare-CaptureTransactions.ps1 `
  -BaselinePath (Join-Path $session.Root "baseline-transactions.json") `
  -ActionPath (Join-Path $session.Root "action-transactions.json") `
  -OutputPath (Join-Path $session.Root "comparison.json")
```

The decoder retains frame number, relative time, direction, endpoint,
setup fields, bounded payload hex, and length. Treat its output as raw until it
has been reviewed and sanitized. A payload difference is a candidate, not a
command definition. The comparer recognizes checksum-valid 90-byte and
374-byte Razer envelopes, with or without a report-ID prefix. It ignores the
transaction ID, checksum, reserved bytes, and unused padding, but retains
status, report ID, command class/ID, payload length, and semantic payload.
Unknown or malformed payloads fall back to exact full-payload comparison.

Some successful USBPcap control-completion frames contain a response body even
when Wireshark leaves every semantic payload field empty. The decoder performs
a second, narrowly filtered `tshark -T json -x` pass for only those IN frames,
removes the declared USBPcap pseudoheader, and labels the bounded body
`UsbPcapFrameData`. Complete raw frames and IRP metadata are never serialized.
This fallback is required before concluding that a command has no ACK or query
response.

Correlate candidates with:

- the exact operator timestamp;
- a repeated capture of the same value;
- a different value in the same control;
- a no-action negative capture; and
- the corresponding read/query traffic.

Identify the report envelope, transaction ID, command class/ID, payload length,
checksum, response status, and which bytes encode the value. Remove unrelated
interrupt input and periodic telemetry.

## 6. Build a query-first fixture

A commit-safe query fixture records:

- model number, VID, PID, BIOS, EC, and MCU when known;
- interface/collection and report ID;
- sanitized request and expected response;
- payload bounds and checksum interpretation;
- transaction correlation and accepted status;
- capture hash and decoder version; and
- negative evidence from nearby traffic.

Implement the query in a typed developer command. The command must verify exact
device identity, reject malformed or mismatched responses, impose a timeout,
and expose no arbitrary payload option.

Run the query repeatedly across:

- service restart;
- device reconnect;
- sleep/resume;
- AC, USB-C, and battery when relevant; and
- vendor software running and stopped.

Query failure must degrade to unavailable without writing.

## 7. Validate a setter

Do not use the generic capture scripts to replay bytes. Add a reviewed typed
validation plan under `plans`, hash-gate its exact bytes in the developer tool,
and present the plan before execution.

The interactive runner must:

1. verify the exact model, PID, and accepted firmware;
2. query and display the prior state;
3. display the exact one-value mutation and restoration;
4. require confirmation;
5. apply one value;
6. query readback and compare it;
7. restore the prior value in `finally`;
8. query restoration and compare it; and
9. emit a bounded result with no raw traffic.

If a getter does not exist, the command remains setter-only and cannot be
profiled, automatically reapplied, or labeled as current state. Visual
confirmation alone does not replace restoration.

## 8. Coverage matrix

Investigate only controls present on the target, but explicitly mark every row
as supported, absent, software-only, or not investigated.

Copy `templates/device-coverage.template.json` for the target. Its schema-2
nested matrix tracks each power context, USB-C power class, lighting variant,
color/duration/direction/region group, lifecycle event, conflict behavior, and
failure mode independently. Keep each capability at `NotInvestigated` until
evidence advances it through capture, query validation, setter validation, and
production admission. Mark a missing target feature `Absent`; do not delete the
row or collapse several variants into one status.

| Area | Minimum capture set |
| --- | --- |
| Identity | descriptors, model, BIOS, EC, MCU, relevant interfaces |
| Performance | every AC/USB-C/battery preset, Custom levels, readback |
| Fans | Auto, fixed range endpoints and step, maximum, manual writes, RPM query |
| Battery | protection off, every advertised limit, temporary full charge, query |
| Keyboard lighting | Off, brightness, each effect, all colors/durations/directions/regions |
| Logo lighting | every mode and getter |
| Keyboard behavior | Fn-primary, Gaming mode, startup animation, device mode |
| Special keys | raw reports for every Fn-layer or dedicated hardware action |
| Display | Windows-visible modes, DRR, HDR, color-profile behavior |
| Lifecycle | cold boot, sign-in, service restart, sleep/resume, reconnect |
| Power | full AC, each supported USB-C class, battery, transitions |
| Conflicts | vendor controller present, external change, explicit reclaim |
| Failures | timeout, malformed response, wrong transaction, unsupported PID |

For effects or controls with multiple variants, capture every variant rather
than assuming a bit flag. For host-rendered effects, capture both the setup
command and enough frame traffic to establish matrix format and cadence.

### Model-specific helpers and evidence ledgers

Model-named scripts are frozen to the identity, interfaces, controller
ownership, expected files, and safety boundary of their reviewed sessions.
Before rerunning one, inspect its parameters and retained evidence, confirm the
exact model and accepted firmware, and use a new ignored output directory. Do
not loosen a hard-coded identity, address, path, signature, or hash check to
make the helper run on another machine.

A retained helper usually has one of these jobs:

1. An oracle-capture wrapper isolates OpenBlade, resolves the USBPcap address,
   keeps the PCAP local, and preserves operator-action and capture-state files.
2. An analyzer or exporter turns a local capture into a bounded, sanitized
   fixture without weakening identity, timing, checksum, or geometry checks.
3. A read-only matrix repeats typed queries across operator-confirmed power or
   lifecycle states while preventing competing reads and restoring any service
   it temporarily isolates.
4. A reversible validator saves exact-device state, applies one bounded value,
   reads it independently, and restores it. A rejected apply or successful
   restoration can still be negative evidence rather than setter admission.
5. An ownership or lifecycle inspector may establish which signed, hash-pinned
   vendor component owns a backend. Ownership, a getter timeout, or static
   analysis does not authorize a kernel driver, vendor dependency, or setter.

Use `decoded/*-device-coverage.json` as the authoritative status matrix for an
exact model and firmware scope. A matching `decoded/*-evidence.json` can
summarize admitted transport, controls, lifecycle behavior, and failure
handling. Other decoded fixtures can hold bounded reports, effect oracles, key
maps, and validation results. Matching annotations record provenance,
isolation, restoration, negative results, and limitations.

Advance every coverage leaf independently. A validated base control or effect
does not automatically validate its parameters, getter, readback, power
contexts, or lifecycle. Keep partial input evidence when some physical reports
are distinguishable and others are not. Installed UI and regression acceptance
prove product behavior only; neither is a firmware command or device readback.

## 9. Sanitize and validate

Create an annotation skeleton:

```powershell
.\tools\New-SanitizedCaptureAnnotation.ps1 `
  -PlanPath (Join-Path $session.Root "capture-plan.json") `
  -StatePath (Join-Path $session.ActionDirectory "capture.state.json") `
  -PcapPath $session.ActionPcap `
  -OutputPath .\annotations\YYYY-MM-DD-action.json
```

Replace placeholders with reviewed, bounded evidence. Never paste an entire
payload stream. Set `action.kind` to `ReadOnlyQuery`, `SettingChange`,
`Observation`, or `NegativeControl`; every `SettingChange` needs successful
prior-state, apply, readback, restoration, and restoration-readback results.
Use the provenance role `OracleCapture`, `ReadOnlyQueryCapture`,
`NegativeCapture`, `ExactDeviceInteractiveValidation`, or
`OpenBladeTypedValidation`, and include the controller name and version.
Each `sanitizedEvidence` item needs a short `kind`, a human-readable `summary`,
and only the bounded fields necessary to reproduce the protocol conclusion.
Then run:

```powershell
.\tools\Test-CaptureEvidence.ps1 `
  -AnnotationPath .\annotations\YYYY-MM-DD-action.json `
  -PcapPath $session.ActionPcap
```

The validator rejects missing provenance, empty or all-device captures without
disclosure, forced shutdown without disclosure, missing restoration outcomes,
local paths, serial-like values, unbounded evidence, and raw capture
extensions. `-PcapPath` is the pre-commit gate: it verifies the stored SHA-256
and byte length against the local raw capture. When reviewing an already
committed annotation without its intentionally untracked PCAP, use the explicit
`-SchemaOnly` mode; it validates schema and redaction but reports that the PCAP
hash was not independently verified.

Run the offline regressions after changing schemas, comparison, sanitization,
coverage, or other toolkit behavior:

```powershell
& "$env:SystemRoot\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" `
  -NoProfile -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File .\tests\Run-All.ps1
```

Use `-NonInteractive` in automation. One regression deliberately omits the
validator's required mode to prove that it fails closed; an interactive
PowerShell host otherwise waits for a mandatory-parameter prompt.

## 10. Production admission

A capability is ready for the OpenBlade production table only when each check
passes independently:

- exact model/PID/firmware scope is explicit;
- at least one sanitized oracle capture is committed;
- request and response decode deterministically;
- checksum, bounds, transaction ID, status, and timeout are validated;
- the typed query works without vendor processes;
- the typed setter applies the requested value;
- readback matches;
- prior state restores and readback confirms restoration;
- unsupported devices and firmware produce zero writes;
- conflict policy produces the intended zero-write or explicit-reclaim result;
- lifecycle and power-state tests pass; and
- unit tests use the committed fixture.

Anything short of this remains capture evidence or a developer-only probe, not
an advertised control.
